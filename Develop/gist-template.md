# REGEX Tutorial

Regex, or regular expressions, are collections of characters that produce text search patterns. Used most frequently in word processors, text editors, and search engines. You may find a thorough description of a specific regex, one that looks for hexadecimals, here. A letter-and-whole-number value scheme is used in hexadecimals. Hex can be difficult to find because they frequently start with a # and have different numbers of characters.

## Summary

The REGEX we will be discussing is a Matching Email expression. We will deconstruct this following statement : /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/.  

To ensure that a user inputs an email address that starts with an arbitrary amount of characters before the @ symbol, followed by a domain, each element of this regex has a specific duty.

We will identify the Anchors, Quantifiers,The OR Operator, Charecter Classes, Grouping and Capturing, Bracket expressions, Greedy and Lazy Match, Boundaries, Back-references, Flags and Look-ahead and Look-behind.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
As researched, Regex 'Anchors' are elements, or tokens, that are known to not match any characters. On the contrary, they are known to create relationships between strings and other related processes. Further, they reserve currently determined locations for strings, whether it be at the beginning or at the end of a string.

I am an IT & DevOPs Engineer that works full-time, and am training as an up-and-coming
Full-Stack Web Developer as a Part-Time Student with Rice University's Coding Bootcamp. Currently, 
I hold 3 Masters across 2 industries (i.e. Business and CyberSecurity), a Bachelor's in Electrical 
and Computer Engineering, and a variety of IT Certifications across 3 IT Vendor-Certifying 
Organizations (i.e. CompTIA, ISACA, Microsoft). My goal as a Web Developer is to 'bridge the gap' 
within my career interests as an aspiring Security & Cloud Engineer & Researcher upon receipt of my 
Ph.D in IT. In my free time, I love to exercise, read, game, spend time with family & friends, 
and play with my dogs.
