# REGEX Tutorial

Regex, or regular expressions, are collections of characters that produce text search patterns. Used most frequently in word processors, text editors, and search engines. You may find a thorough description of a specific regex, one that looks for hexadecimals, here. A letter-and-whole-number value scheme is used in hexadecimals. Hex can be difficult to find because they frequently start with a # and have different numbers of characters.

## Summary

The REGEX we will be discussing is a Matching Email expression. We will deconstruct this following statement : /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/.  

To ensure that a user inputs an email address that starts with an arbitrary amount of characters before the @ symbol, followed by a domain, each element of this regex has a specific duty.

We will identify the Anchors, Quantifiers,The OR Operator, Charecter Classes, Grouping and Capturing, Bracket expressions, Greedy and Lazy Match, Boundaries, Back-references, Flags and Look-ahead and Look-behind.
